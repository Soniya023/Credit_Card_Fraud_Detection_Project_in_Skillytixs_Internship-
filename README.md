# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection  

## ✅ Objective  
The goal of this project is to build a **machine learning model** that can accurately classify and detect fraudulent transactions in a **highly imbalanced dataset** using real-world financial data.  

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies Used  
- **Programming & Libraries:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn  
- **Techniques:** Logistic Regression, Data Preprocessing, Imbalanced Data Handling (Under-sampling)  
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score  

## 📊 Project Workflow  

### 🔍 1. Data Understanding  
- Loaded a dataset of **284,807 transactions**, among which only **492 were fraudulent** (severe class imbalance).  
- Verified **no missing values**, ensuring dataset quality.  

### 📊 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Performed **statistical analysis** and `.describe()` summary.  
- Identified **significant differences** in feature distributions between fraud and legitimate transactions.  

### ⚖️ 3. Handling Class Imbalance  
- Applied **under-sampling** to create a balanced dataset with equal counts of fraud (1) and legitimate (0) transactions (**492 each**).  

### 🧠 4. Model Development  
- Split the balanced dataset into **training and testing sets**.  
- Trained a **Logistic Regression model** for binary classification.  

### 📈 5. Model Evaluation  
- Achieved **95.5% accuracy** on training data.  
- Achieved **93.4% accuracy** on testing data.  
- Results demonstrate effective **generalization and robustness**.  

## 🎯 Outcome  
This project demonstrates how **machine learning** can be effectively applied in the **finance domain** to:  
- Detect and prevent fraudulent transactions  
- Protect customers and financial institutions  
- Optimize **risk management systems**
